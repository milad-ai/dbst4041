# **Course Objectives**
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **database management systems (DBMS)** and their role in modern data-driven applications. It covers the **fundamentals of database theory**, **conceptual and logical design**, and **data access and manipulation** while emphasizing **best practices** for modeling, implementation, and optimization.

Students will gain proficiency in **relational database concepts** through **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**, mapping ER diagrams to **relational schemas**, applying **normalization techniques**, and formulating complex **SQL queries** for real-world analytical tasks.

The course also introduces key **data concepts and ethical considerations**:  

- Understanding the **data hierarchy (DIKW pyramid: Data ‚Üí Information ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Wisdom)**.  
- Introducing **bias and basic ethical issues** in working with data, along with emerging concepts such as **dataism**.  
- Learning the **four levels of data analytics**: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.  

Beyond the fundamentals, the course introduces **modern trends and tools** in database management, such as:

- **Embedded and analytical databases** (e.g., DuckDB) for fast local processing.
- **Analytical vs transactional systems**: understanding **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** vs **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**.
- **Introduction to NoSQL databases** (e.g., MongoDB) and understanding when to choose them over relational systems.
- **Query optimization and indexing** for improved performance in large datasets. 
- **Big Data frameworks** (e.g., PySpark) for large-scale data analytics.  
- **Vector Databases** and their role in **AI-driven semantic search** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  
- **Integration with visualization tools** (Power BI) and **web applications** (Streamlit) for presenting insights interactively.
- **API development** for exposing database functionality and enabling programmatic access to data.

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Introduce fundamental concepts, terminology, and applications of databases.  
- Design ER models for simple applications and convert them into relational tables.
- Differentiate between **OLAP and OLTP systems** and understand their real-world use cases.
- Formulate SQL queries effectively for data retrieval and manipulation.  
- Utilize normalization techniques to enhance database design.  
- Compare relational approaches with **NoSQL** paradigms and understand their trade-offs.
- Learn to connect databases with **Python** and perform **data analysis with Pandas and PySpark**.  
- Perform **data extraction, transformation, and visualization** to support business decisions.
- Build basic **APIs** to expose and integrate database functionalities into external applications.


The primary hands-on environment will be **PostgreSQL**, supplemented by **DuckDB, Marimo notebooks, and Power BI**, providing both industry-standard and cutting-edge perspectives on database management.

In the final project, students will design and implement a complete database system from conceptual modeling to relational implementation, accompanied by an interactive analytical dashboard and a simple web application for data exploration and reporting.

## **Homework Assignments**

Throughout the course, students will complete several homework assignments aimed at reinforcing the concepts covered in lectures and reading materials (See the [homework page](https://statdb.ir/assignments/), which will be updated during the course). The due dates for these assignments will be posted on this website.

Please follow the instructions to turn in your homework:
- Homeworks must be submitted electronically as PDF files.
- Files should be named according to the following scheme:
   - HW<2-digits homework number>\_\<LastName>\_\<FirstName>.pdf.
   - For instance, my first homework would be called HW01_Vazan_Milad.pdf.
- üìß Email your homework to **hw@statdb.ir**

## **Exams**

The course will include **two exams**. Both exams will assess the required readings and topics covered in class. The first exam will be an "in-class" [midterm](https://statdb.ir/exams), while the second will be a [final exam](https://statdb.ir/exams) scheduled during the University's final examination period at the end of the semester.

**If you need to miss the midterm test due to illness or a family affliction, please contact me by email. A make-up exam for the midterm might be organized.**

## **Seeking Assistance**

Here are the available help resources, organized by the urgency of your issue:

### **Messaging**
Our course will utilize a Telegram group (link to be provided in class) as the primary communication platform for announcements and discussions. This is an ideal space for asking questions that can be answered by anyone. It's best to use this resource for non-urgent inquiries.

### **Talk with the Instructor**
For any issues at all, please reach out to the instructor:

- Speak with me before class  
- Raise your hand or speak up during class


## **Collaboration Policy**

You are encouraged to discuss the content of this course with anyone you like; however, it is essential to **maintain academic integrity** in your work. All homework assignments, projects, and exams must be completed independently, meaning you are not permitted to copy any part of another student‚Äôs solution, collaborate with others on your assignments, or use solutions from unauthorized sources, including the Internet. **Therefore, the solution you submit for each assignment must be solely your own, reflecting your understanding and effort.**

## **Generative AI Usage Guidelines**

## 1. Purpose of These Guidelines
Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude) can support your learning by explaining concepts, suggesting code examples, and offering design guidance. However, the **primary goal of this course** is for you to personally develop the skills, not rely solely on ready-made answers. These guidelines ensure deep learning, academic honesty, and ethical use.



## 2. Allowed Uses
You are encouraged to use generative AI tools for the following purposes:

- **Explaining Concepts**  
  Asking about differences, applications, or underlying theory (e.g., the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL).

- **Debugging Guidance**  
  Asking what a specific error means and exploring strategies to fix it.

- **Best Practices**  
  Example: ‚ÄúHow should I manage database connections securely in Python?‚Äù

- **Exploring Libraries and Tools**  
  Example: ‚ÄúWhich libraries are available for connecting Python to PostgreSQL?‚Äù

- **Improving Code Readability or Design**  
  Requesting feedback to simplify queries or optimize algorithms.

- **Comparing Approaches**  
  Example: ‚ÄúWhat are the advantages of SQL vs. NoSQL, or Pandas vs. PySpark?‚Äù
