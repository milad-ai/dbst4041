title: Generative AI Usage Guidelines
permalink: /AI_Guidelines/
---

## 1. Purpose of These Guidelines
Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude) can support your learning by explaining concepts, suggesting code examples, and offering design guidance. However, the **primary goal of this course** is for you to personally develop the skills, not rely solely on ready-made answers. These guidelines ensure deep learning, academic honesty, and ethical use.

## 2. Allowed Uses
You are encouraged to use generative AI tools for the following purposes:
- **Explaining Concepts**  
  Asking about differences, applications, or underlying theory (e.g., the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL).
- **Debugging Guidance**  
  Asking what a specific error means and exploring strategies to fix it.
- **Best Practices**  
  Example: “How should I manage database connections securely in Python?”
- **Exploring Libraries and Tools**  
  Example: “Which libraries are available for connecting Python to PostgreSQL?”
- **Improving Code Readability or Design**  
  Requesting feedback to simplify queries or optimize algorithms.
- **Comparing Approaches**  
  Example: “What are the advantages of SQL vs. NoSQL, or Pandas vs. PySpark?”
- **Learning Through Simple Examples**  
  Understanding patterns and structures without requesting final answers to assignments.

## 3. Prohibited Uses
Please **do not** use generative AI tools for the following:
- **Directly Solving Course Assignments or Projects**  
  Requesting final code or answers for graded work.
- **Bypassing the Learning Process**  
  Copying AI-generated solutions without understanding them.
- **Sharing Proprietary Course Content**  
  Posting full assignment or project descriptions into AI tools.
- **Using AI as the Only Source**  
  Ignoring course notes, lectures, and official documentation.

## 4. Transparency and Academic Integrity
- If you used generative AI in your work, **disclose it clearly** and explain how you used it (e.g., “I used ChatGPT to help explain a SQL error”).  
- Any misuse (e.g., submitting AI-generated answers as your own) violates academic honesty policies and may result in disciplinary action.

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Acceptable Questions
- “How can I remove duplicate records in SQL?”
- “What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?”
- “What visualization tools are available in Python that are similar to Power BI?”
- “Is there a more efficient way to normalize this database schema?”

### 5.2 Unacceptable Questions
- “Write the solution for Question 3 of Week 5’s assignment.”
- “Generate the complete code for the final project.”
- “Optimize this exact query from my homework and give me the final answer.”
- “Provide me with a ready-to-submit file for this task.”


## 6. Best Practices for Using Generative AI
- Treat AI responses as **guidance**, not final solutions.  
- Use AI to **enhance your understanding**, not replace your own problem-solving.  
- Ensure **progressive learning**: try solving on your own first, then use AI for clarification.
