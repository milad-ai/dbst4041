## **Introduction to Databases and Data Concepts (1 week)** 
- Overview of course structure, grading, and final project.
- Role of databases in data-driven applications.
- Data types: structured, semi-structured, unstructured.
- **DIKW pyramid** (Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom).
- Levels of data analytics: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive.
- Ethical considerations and bias in data.
- Basic database terminology (tables, rows, columns, keys). 


## **Overview of Database Models and ER Design (1–2 weeks)**
- Introduction to **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling)**.  
- Entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality.  
- Conceptual modeling for real-world datasets.  
- Weak entities and composite attributes. 
- Multi-valued attributes and derived attributes.  


## **Relational Model and Mapping ER to Relational Schema (1 week)**
- Introduction to the relational model (tables, primary keys, foreign keys).  
- Mapping ER diagrams to relational tables.  
- Constraints and integrity rules.  
- Example: converting an ER diagram of a sample dataset into a relational schema.  



## **Introduction to PostgreSQL and Basic SQL (1 week)**
- Setting up PostgreSQL and connecting via GUI/CLI.  
- Creating databases and tables.  
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records.  
- Simple queries: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`.  


## **Intermediate SQL Queries (2-3 weeks)**
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.  
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering with `HAVING`.  
- Sorting and combining data with `JOIN` (inner, outer).  
- Practical exercises on real datasets.  



## **Advanced SQL Queries (2-3 weeks)**
- Nested queries and subqueries.  
- Set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`.  
- Window functions (ranking, moving averages).  
- Query performance basics (indexes and execution plans – overview only).  


## **Introduction to Analytical Databases and DuckDB (1 week)**
- Concept of **analytical databases** and how they differ from transactional ones (OLAP vs OLTP).  
- Introduction to **DuckDB** and why it’s useful for local analytics.  
- Setting up DuckDB and basic commands.  
- Importing CSV and Parquet files directly into DuckDB.  


## **Data Exploration with DuckDB (1 week)**
- Combining DuckDB with **Pandas** for hybrid workflows.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): summary statistics, filtering, grouping.  
- Hands-on: analyzing a sample dataset 


## **Data Cleaning and Transformation (1 week)**
- Handling missing data and outliers.  
- Converting data types and formatting.  
- Creating computed columns and derived tables.  
- Practical: preparing a dataset for analysis.  


## **Data Visualization and Reporting (1 week)**
- Basics of visualization tools: **Power BI** and **Streamlit**.  
- Connecting visualization tools to DuckDB/Postgres.  
- Building dashboards for interactive data reporting.  


## **Modern Trends in Databases (Overview) (1 week)**
- NoSQL databases and their use cases (document, key-value, graph).  
- Vector databases and their role in semantic search and AI workflows.  
- Overview of query optimization and indexing (analytical perspective).  
- Future trends in analytical data management.
