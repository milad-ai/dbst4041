## **Introduction to Databases and Data Concepts**
- Course structure, grading, and project overview.  
- Introduction to **data and data analysis**: structured vs unstructured data.  
- Overview of **big data** and its characteristics. 
- Types of data analytics: **descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive**.  
- Definition and purpose of **database management systems (DBMS)**.  
- Basic database terminology (tables, rows, columns, keys).  


## **Overview of Database Models and ER Design**
- Types of database models: hierarchical, network, relational, NoSQL (overview).  
- Introduction to **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling)**.  
- Entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality.  
- Conceptual modeling for real-world datasets.  
- Weak entities and composite attributes. 
- Multi-valued attributes and derived attributes.  


## **Relational Model and Mapping ER to Relational Schema**
- Introduction to the relational model (tables, primary keys, foreign keys).  
- Mapping ER diagrams to relational tables.  
- Constraints and integrity rules.  
- Example: converting an ER diagram of a sample dataset into a relational schema.  



## **Introduction to PostgreSQL and Basic SQL**
- Setting up PostgreSQL and connecting via GUI/CLI.  
- Creating databases and tables.  
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records.  
- Simple queries: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`.  


## **Intermediate SQL Queries**
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.  
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering with `HAVING`.  
- Sorting and combining data with `JOIN` (inner, outer).  
- Practical exercises on real datasets.  



## **Advanced SQL Queries**
- Nested queries and subqueries.  
- Set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`.  
- Window functions (ranking, moving averages).  
- Query performance basics (indexes and execution plans â€“ overview only).  


## **Introduction to Analytical Databases and DuckDB**
- Concept of **analytical databases** and how they differ from transactional ones (OLAP vs OLTP).  
- Introduction to **DuckDB** and why itâ€™s useful for local analytics.  
- Setting up DuckDB and basic commands.  
- Importing CSV and Parquet files directly into DuckDB.  


## **Data Exploration with DuckDB**
- Querying datasets directly from storage (no ETL).  
- Combining DuckDB with **Pandas** for hybrid workflows.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): summary statistics, filtering, grouping.  
- Hands-on: analyzing a sample dataset (e.g., population or survey data).  


## **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- Handling missing data and outliers.  
- Converting data types and formatting.  
- Creating computed columns and derived tables.  
- Practical: preparing a dataset for analysis.  


## **Integrating Databases with Python**
- Connecting PostgreSQL and DuckDB with Python.  
- Executing queries and retrieving results programmatically.  
- Using **Pandas** for additional analysis and visualization.  
- Simple statistical operations within Python workflows.  


## **Data Visualization and Reporting**
- Basics of visualization tools: **Power BI** and **Streamlit**.  
- Connecting visualization tools to DuckDB/Postgres.  
- Building dashboards for interactive data reporting.  


## **Modern Trends in Databases (Overview)**
- NoSQL databases and their use cases (document, key-value, graph).  
- Vector databases and their role in semantic search and AI workflows.  
- Overview of query optimization and indexing (analytical perspective).  
- Future trends in analytical data management.
